The meetup started with Shreyas setting the context. He gave a short
presentation on what a meet-up is, and what is it not, and what to
expect. After that we went in for the talks.

The first talk was Environment for a Python Dev by Dinesh Kumar He
talked about setting-up and using a working environment for python
development using various tools an libraries. He covered the
following:

  - How code with `print` could break in Python 3, pyenv shell can
    help change python versions. And how it also helps with library
    dependencies.

  - How provisioning tools like Ansible can be used along with pyenv
    to help setup project dependencies.

  - On how to do build and tests, and use tests as documentation

  - On choices for linters and style checkers: Pylink, Pep8, pyflakes

  - And about how to use PYVERBOSE

Then we all stepped out for a coffee break.

The next talk was on Debugging the easy way with python debugger by

sophisticated alternative called pdgpp. The speaker also went into a
demo of the debugging session using an encryption program.

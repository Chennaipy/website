## Talks

### Postgresql Explain

Speaker: Abishek

Postgres Explain is an interesting starting point to understand how
the Postgresql database approaches queries. It gives us insights into
its various algorithms, use of indexing and general trade-offs. In
this talk I try walking thought various examples of explain, and pick
up some quick lessons.

### Introduction to pgcli and mycli

Speaker: Amjith Ramanujan

Pgcli is a modern command line interface for Postgresql database that
can do auto-completion of sql statements and syntax highlighting. This
talk will be a walkthrough of the tool and introduce the various
libraries that made this tool possible. Mycli is the mysql equivalent
of pgcli. Both the tools are open source and they are written in
Python.

### Image Processing Using OpenCV

Speaker: Haripriya Baskar

In this talk, I will be presenting my project on image processing
using OpenCV for clinical GAIT Analysis. OpenCV is popular computer
vision library for image and video processing in real-time.

### Pretty Printing in Python

Speaker: Shakthi Kannan

This talk shares the experience of creating a part from an art using
Printrun and Skeinforge with the Prusia i3 3D printer. MTConnect
standard is used to obtain data from the 3D printer. I shall also
address the challenges in validating the printed object ("Part to
Art") using Python tools.

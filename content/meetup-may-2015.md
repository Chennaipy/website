## Talk Details

### Predictive Models at Scale using Dumbo

Speaker: Nikhil Ketkar

The data science stack for Python is mature and robust. Libraries like Numpy,
SciPy and scikit-learn allow data scientists to build predictive models easily.
However, when it comes to making predictions on large volumes remains an
operational challenging. Data scientists typically end up using Python just for
prototyping models and then implement models in Java so they can leverage
Hadoop. With libraries like Dumbo make it possible to build and run machine
learning models in Python that can make predictions over very large datasets.
The talk will describe the problem and the proposed solution with example code.

### Memory Management in Python

Speaker: Vijay Kumar

The talk will cover the following topics: How Reference Counting Works, Issues
with Reference Counting , Cycle Detection and GC, Useful Third Party Modules.
Not many people really require to know how Python manages memory. But it is
kind of nice to know how things work under the hood.

### Building a face detection tool using OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 

Speaker: Gaurav Sehrawat 

This talk will include learning about picamera module and opencv.I will be
using Haar's Cascade classifier as training model for facedetection.And a real
case scenario of using it.

### All things *Py*

Speaker: Krishna Sangeeth

Random assorted stuff on Python taken from the world wide web thingy. This is a
pretty basic beginner friendly talk which i hope would resonate with beginners.

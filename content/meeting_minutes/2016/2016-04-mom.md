## Talks

### Trash of the Titans 

Speaker: Bhaskar

The talk will cover the following topics: 

- GC concepts
- Algorithms
- GC in Ruby
- GC in Python
- GC in Java
- GC in Erlang. 

My hope is that the polyglot audience will engage in a lively discussion, each
arguing the merits of their pet languages.

### Machine Learning with Python

Speaker: Manish

The plan is to provide an introduction to the basic concepts of machine
learning, tools in python for machine learning and explanation of algorithms
for Linear Regression and Classification along with a live demo.

### Web Scrapping with Scrapple 

Speaker: Alex Mathew

An introductory talk on web scraping, and how basic patterns in web scrapers
have been generalized in [Scrapple](https://github.com/AlexMathew/scrapple). It
will be a live demo of some basic web scrapers/crawlers for some sites like
xkcd and ESPN, and how these have been abstracted to create configurable web
content extractors using Scrapple.

### Ansible mode in Emacs 

Speaker: Shakti Kannan

This talk will introduce Ansible minor mode, ansible-doc and company-ansible
back-end in GNU Emacs. I shall also address Literate DevOps in this context.

## Diving deep into dictionary

Speaker: Naren

Every pythonista knows how to use a dictionary. They claim its the
fastest data structure in python and tell, one should not expect
ordered elements from it (Atleast in python 2.x). But I am not sure
how many of them are aware what happens when a dictionary is
initialized?, why its not ordered?, why is it so fast?, how it alters
itself when it grows?. I will talk about all of these and after the
talk the audience will know whats really happening behind a
dictionary.

## Demystifying how imports work in Python

Speaker: Tasdik Rahman

It just so happens python abstracts away the inner workings of import
statement beautifully. But are we aware of how python behaves when it
encounters an import statement for a module? Better yet what is a
module actually? Packages anybody? How would different import styles
compare with each other. Any Best practices when importing
modules. What about that __init__.py you saw the last time you read
someone else's code.

## Introduction to selenium in Python

Speaker: Mayur Shah

I'll be explaining them about, what selenium is? How it helps with
browser automations. How we can use it for testing? Selenium ide and
webdriver. Also I'll be showing demo and how to code.

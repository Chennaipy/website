## Talks

### Introduction to PySpark

Speaker: Tanigaiarassane

* Spark concepts
* Python functional programming constructs
* map, reduce, filter etc
* pySpark programming - with some examples. 

### Introduction to Celery 

Speaker: Shanmuga

Cases when number of tasks are submitted to task queue which needs to be
processed asynchronously Celery saves the day. Celery distributes and
coordinates the tasks over multiple workers (may be running on different
machine). It also scales well with addition/removal of workers on the fly to
handle those occasional burst work load between long periods of calm.

With the flexibility to support multiple message brokers and custom extension
for various modules it addresses a wide variety of retirements.

### Code Optimization in Python 

Speaker: Ashok

I am referring to the following 2 links. They have some good material.

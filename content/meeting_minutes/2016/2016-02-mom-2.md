## Talks

### Python Extended Window manager Hints using Xlib

Speaker: Rengaraj

This talk will cover some basic of X Window system, which is currently
used by most GNU/Linux Distros. Xlib is the library used by X11 server
to display windows of various X11 client like browser, terminal,
etc. Using Python "ewmh" library we can learn X window system in
GNU/Linux.

### Analysis of Algorithms

Speaker: Ashok Govindarajan

The talk will cover the following topics:

  * Other ways of computing complexity of algorithms besides Big O

  * Comparison of iterative, recursive and tail-recursive algorithms

### Experimental Mathematics with Python and Sage

Speaker: Amritanshu Prasad

According to the Russian Mathematician V I Arnold (see
[http://tinyurl.com/abgbec](http://tinyurl.com/abgbec)): " Mathematics
is a part of physics. Physics is an experimental science, a part of
natural science. Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments
are cheap." I will talk about some of my mathematical experiments.

### BitBake, the Embedded Linux Build Engine

Speaker: Vijay Kumar

This talk is about how a Python based build engine is revolutionizing
the way Embedded Linux systems are built and maintained. We will cover
the features of BitBake and also show how to write simple BitBake
recipes.

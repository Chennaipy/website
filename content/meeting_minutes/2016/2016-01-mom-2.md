## Talks

### Environment for a Python Dev

Speaker: Dinesh Kumar

Working with different project with different python versions,
debugging module issues, Introduction to development
environment/provisioning. Have a look at: pyenv-virtualenv, pip,
modules, site, ansible.

### Algorithmic analysis and Time complexity in Python

Speaker: Ashok Govindarajan

This talk will be on the following lines:

  * Measuring the execution time of algorithms in Python - simple
    addition program

  * Big O Notation

  * Time complexity of Python Operations.

### Debugging the easy way with python debugger

Speaker: Gaurav Sehrawat

An easy replacement of "print" statement is python debugger. It is
command line utility. Getting more insight in complex code is piece of
cake with PDB, since you interact directly with code in running
state. It is an essential zen tool for every python developer.

### Offset Pagination in Databases

Speaker: Abhishek Yadav

Offset pagination is a popular technique to get split sets of data
from a database. While made convenient with the OFFSET clause in Sql,
it comes with its own problems. We take a look at the problems created
by Offset pagination, and the possible solutions.

## Introduction to PyGTK
### Speaker: Ashok Kumar

The author used PyGTK in their Digital Signage Project to manage many LCD and LED devices. They need to display images, videos, and webpages.

They used **Xibo**, an open-source software to manage remote displays and schedule content. Each player was a remote node.

### PyGTK
- Built on the GTK+ library, PyGTK exposes most of the features available in GTK+.
- Works on **Windows**, **MacOS**, **Linux**.
- Several advantages over GTK+:
  - No need to worry about pointers and memory management.
  - Quick prototyping and easy development.
- **Widgets**: Components for building interfaces.
  - Control and display widgets.
  - Containers for holding widgets (e.g., Window, frames).

### Glade
- GUI creation using drag-and-drop.
- The exported XML can be used directly in PyGTK to build the program, saving hours of coding.

## Accessing Spreadsheets in Python
### Speaker: Praveen Kumar

Praveen emphasized using **virtualenv** to clone the Python environment and avoid conflicts with the system Python.

### Steps to Access Spreadsheets Programmatically:
- Connect to the workbook.
- Access the worksheet and read/write cells.
- Modify and save cells.

### Spreadsheet from Scratch in Python
- Automates manual tasks.
- Uses **MS Excel** or **LibreOffice** spreadsheets.
- Data stored in text files (e.g., **Yaml** for version control).

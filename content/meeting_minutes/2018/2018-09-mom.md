# MOM - September 2018 Chennaipy Meetup

The meeting took place on **September 22, 2018**, from **4 PM to 6:45 PM**.

### Talk 1: Data Compression Techniques
**Speaker:** Bharathwaaj S

- Data compression involves minimizing the byte size without degrading quality.
- **Lossy** and **lossless** data compressions were discussed.
- **Information theory** and its application to data compression (Huffman Coding) were explored.
- A fun fact: Data compression methods were already used in **Morse code** in 1836 before Shannon formalized them in 1948.

### Talk 2: Last Mile Problem in Machine Learning
**Speaker:** Vijay Kumar

- **ML Model Tracking**: Discussed the importance of tracking training data, code, hyperparameters, and results for reproducibility.
- **MLFlow** was introduced as a tool to help manage ML experiments.
- Importance of organizing code and exposing models like libraries.
- Deployed models to **AWS SageMaker**.

### Talk 3: Pysangamam - Lessons Learnt
**Speaker:** Bharathwaaj S

- **Event Recap**: Timeline included 2 keynotes, 16 20-minute slots, 16 poster slots, and 12 lightning talks.
- Key takeaways: 
  - **Zen of Event Planning**: Start local > national > international.
  - Prototype before implementation and focus on quality.
  - Rehearsals and well-managed time ensured a positive reception.
- Challenges: Sponsorship difficulties, lack of volunteers, and the need for better planning of logistics like food.

### Talk 4: Importance of Unit Testing
**Speaker:** Vijay Kumar

- **Unit testing** is crucial for stable software and preventing regressions.
- Discussed **mocking** external dependencies and using tools like **pytest** and **flake8**.
- Importance of logging in databases for disaster recovery.

Nikil took everyone into how we can build predictive models using
Dumbo. He highlighted how the legacy predictive model which uses
Python for modeling and use of java based system for production
environment. Finally, he clearly demonstrates how the DUMBO frameworks
helps data scientist to save enormous amount of time by building
predictive models and production environment with simple examples.



## 3.42 PM - 4.20 PM: Memory Management in Python, Vijay kumar

We had a classical talk once again from Vijay kumar, which helps
everyone to visualize how the memory is allocated to an variable in

Gourav demonstrated the face detection algorithm, which he developed
using OpenCV. He showed line by line the code for using OpenCV and for
capturing images using RaspberryPi camera module. Finally he shared
some of his hackathon experience to everyone.

## 5.13 PM - 5.48 PM: All things *py*, Krishna

followed by different flavors of Python and its corresponding unique
features. Everyone came to know about .pyc file information like magic

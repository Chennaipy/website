## Talks

### Developing Odoo Modules

Speaker: Sri Ramadas

A quick demonstration on setting up and running Odoo 9 and customizing
a Module to suit one's requirement. Customization involves: Extending
a Class, its view and some of its methods.

### Python Byte Code Hacking

Speaker: Vijay Kumar B

The talk will cover the following topics: 

  * Byte Code Execution 
  * Stack Machines 
  * Code Objects 
  * Creating Custom Code Objects 

### Python for Microcontrollers

Speaker: Babu Subash Chandar

MicroPython is a lean and fast implementation of the Python 3
optimised to run on a microcontroller. This talk gives an brief
overview on,

  * Features of MicroPython.
  * How it can be run on NuttX, a Real Time Operating System.
  * Layering in NuttX that provides support to run MicroPython.

### Introduction to MIMO Systems

Speaker: Ashok Govindarajan

Basicallly, MIMO is about Multi-antenna communication systems. This
topic would be discussed under the context of base stations (4G,
WiMAX, HSPA+), where multiple antennae are being deployed. The primary
focus would be to :

  * Define SISO (Single input single output systems)
  * Provide a simple analogy to faciliate the understanding of SISO
  * Motivate the idea of MISO (Multiple input single output) and MIMO
  * Present some comparison results between SISO and MIMO.

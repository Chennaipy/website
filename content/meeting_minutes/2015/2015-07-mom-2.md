## Talks

### Automating things using Selenium

### Data Science 101

Speaker: Gaurav

Introduction to probabilistic model particularly Bayesian theory. Solving one Kaggle machine learning  problem based on Bayesian  model using tools like scylearn, numpy, pandas and ipython.

### Building Git From Scratch

Speaker: Vijay Kumar

This talk will incrementally build a prototype of Git in Python. The idea is to learn how Git works, by building a miniature version of it. We will see how files are tracked by Git, how commits are stored, how branching works, and if time permits how merging works.

### The beauty that is PostgreSQL - Part 1

Speakers: Shrayas & Karthik

This session will highlight a few of the brilliant things
that come with the latest PostgreSQL Database.

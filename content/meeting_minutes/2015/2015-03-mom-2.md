## Talk Details

### Python-powered brain simulations

Speaker: Ashutosh Mohan

This talk will have two parts. 1. The specific: how I used python for my
doctoral research on the dynamics of neurons, their connections, and neuronal
networks. 2. the general: how python, with it's simplicity, power, and openness
is becoming the de facto language for computational neuroscience research.

### Bitten By Python

Speaker: Vijay Kumar

Python puts lots of power in the hands of the developer. It takes lot of
discipline to wield it, without hurting oneself. Through this talk I would like
to convey my experiences, the techniques I have learnt and hope to inspire
others to adopt them.

### My Python-BCI journey.

Speaker: Kannan

If GUI is WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) then BCI could become WYTIWYG
(what you think is what you get). This talk would be an intro on BCI, use of
python in creating brain controlled apps and live demos. 

### Python scripting in Android using SL4A

Speaker: Sivasubramanyam

SL4A allows to run scripts in android using most APIs that are available to
native apps except that the process is simpler. It can be used to build
anything from home automation systems to high altitude ballooning projects.

### How Emacs + org-mode replaced a few apps in my workflow

Speaker: Kiran Gangadharan

In this talk, I'll present a short demo about using org-mode in Emacs and how
it has replaced the functionality of a few apps in my workflow.

### Up and running with PySpark

Speaker: Krishna Sangeeth

Pyspark is the python binding available for Apache spark. Spark is now a really
popular project under ASF and through the talk we can look at some basic spark
concepts and using PySpark. 

### Sentiment Analysis in Simple Steps 

Speaker: Sharmila Gopirajan

This talk is an exploration of the natural language processing capabilities of
python through a simple implementation of Sentiment Analysis using a naive
bayes approach.

### Creating Command Line Interface using Docopt
Speaker: Rengaraj

Docopt is a pythonic command line arguments parser. With Docopt, the
usage documentation is written first, and passed on to Docopt, which
uses this to create the parser! This talk will be a short talk on
using Docopt.

### Building Embedded Systems with Twisted

Speaker: Vijay Kumar

Twisted is an asynchronous networking engine written in Python. This
talk will show how we, at Zilogic Systems, built an automated library
management system, using Twisted and an ARM board running Emdebian
Grip. The system uses an RFID reader for user authentication, reed
switches to monitor the shelves and a buzzer to raise alerts.

If you would like to give a lightning talk, just come prepared, we
will be able to accommodate you.

## RSVP

This time around we are planning to serve tea and snacks during the
meet. So do us a favour, and [RSVP on our Meetup

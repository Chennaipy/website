## Talk Details

### Python and its Functions

Speaker: [Shrayas Rajagopal](http://www.meetup.com/Chennaipy/members/31218952/)

Functions in Python are First class. They can be passed to and from
functions. They can be created inside other functions and a lot
more. This talk proposes to introduce this concept.

### Breaking Free with Rope

Speaker: [Vijay Kumar](http://www.meetup.com/Chennaipy/members/147018982/)

Embedded systems have crazy restrictions. And one embedded Python
interpreter I happened to work on, had a restriction that you couldn't
have more that 500 distinct variable names in your application! We
quickly hit this limit. This talk will cover how we overcame this
restriction using Rope, a refactoring library for Python and some
Python scripting hackery.

### Introduction to Sage

Speaker: [Amritanshu Prasad](http://www.meetup.com/Chennaipy/members/182681977/)

Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under
the GPL. It builds on top of many existing open-source packages:
NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many
more. This talk will be an introduction to Sage.

### Sentiment Analysis using Python

Speaker: [Venkatesh](http://www.meetup.com/Chennaipy/members/121391002/)

On a Sunday afternoon, you are bored. You want to watch a particular
movie, but you know there are mixed reviews for the movie. You want to
know the overall feeling on the movie, based on their reviews and not
just based on their ratings. We will show you how to use a machine
learning model to classify the sentiment of a review automatically,
all with Python!!

### Solving graph problems using NetworkX

Speaker: Krishna Sangeeth

NetworkX is a python package which can be used for handling
graphs. Through the talk I want to touch on how we see problems which
can be solved by graph all around and how we can leverage the NetworkX
module to solve challenging problems.

### Decorators 

Speaker: [Shrayas Rajagopal](http://www.meetup.com/Chennaipy/members/31218952/)

Decorators are an interesting way of doing some magic with functions
in Python. Talk 1 (Python and its Functions) will set the base for
this. If time permits and people are interested, we can see an
application of Talk 1 VIZ Decorators. Decorators are a concept that is
gaining widespread use in Python because it is just that easy to
read. This talk proposes to give an introduction to them.

### Building a Website Using Static Site Generators

Speaker: [Gaurav Sherawat](http://www.meetup.com/Chennaipy/members/73333582/)

Static site generator is a software/framework which outputs html files
by combining text and templates, thus generating a website/blog. This
talk will focus on how to use few of them & host the site on github.

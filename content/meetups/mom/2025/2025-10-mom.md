  ## Talk Details

  * From Prompt to Production: GenAI and Python Functions for AWS Infrastructure by Suraj
  
    Suraj demonstrated how organizations can use [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/), a Kubernetes-native Infrastructure-as-Code ([IaC](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/)) platform, to deploy artifacts directly to production. He compared a sample [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) JSON configuration with its Crossplane YAML equivalent and showed how infrastructure changes—specifically updates to an AWS S3 bucket—can be managed through Crossplane. The workflow involved generating a pull request to GitHub, and upon approval, the changes were automatically propagated to production using [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

  * Next-Gen CPython by [Guru Vigneshwaran](https://www.meetup.com/members/113386052)
    
    Guru guided the audience through the next-generation enhancements in CPython focusing on performance, concurrency and production operability. He explored how incremental garbage collection and a just-in-time (JIT) compiler are being introduced to reduce pause-times and boost throughput. He also covered annotation libraries (“Annotationlib”), multiple interpreter support and other runtime layers, along with zero-overhead debugging facilities and advanced async I/O introspection capabilities. Throughout the talk, both theoretical concepts and practical demonstrations were used to show how CPython’s internals are evolving to meet modern scalable use-cases.
  * Embedded Graphics & Game programming using OpenGL by [Praveen](https://www.meetup.com/members/63329772)

    Praveen explained the differences between CPU vs GPU workloads, various stages in graphics rendering pipeline and in [OpenGL ES](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/opengl/about-opengl) library in detail. OpenGL ES library is leveraged by the Embedded Systems, Computer and Mobile devices. He did a walkthrough of sample Python code and graphics definition in C program. He introduces the [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/), which is a next generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in PCs, consoles, mobile phones and embedded platforms.

  * HTTP3 QUIC by [Rengaraj](https://www.meetup.com/members/153069272)
    
    [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) is the latest evolution of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, designed to improve the performance, reliability, and security of web communications. Unlike its predecessors that relied on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), HTTP/3 is built on QUIC, a modern transport protocol developed by Google and standardized by the [IETF](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114). QUIC uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to enable faster connection establishment and reduced latency through features like 0-RTT handshakes and built-in encryption equivalent to TLS 1.3. It also addresses the “head-of-line blocking” issue seen in HTTP/2 by allowing multiple data streams to be delivered independently, ensuring that packet loss on one stream doesn’t delay others. As a result, HTTP/3 delivers smoother, faster web experiences, particularly useful for mobile networks and applications requiring real-time responsiveness.

  * Google AppScript by [Arockiaraj](https://www.meetup.com/members/214913183)
    
    Arockiaraj demonstrated an event management usecase where he automated meeting invite creation by populating the meeting date/time, meeting link, description and feedback document attachment automation by pulling the data from various Google spreadsheets and documents using [AppScript](https://developers.google.com/apps-script).

**Speaker:** Vijayakumar

- **Introduction to Testing**: Various types of testing like Unit Testing and Integration Testing were explained.
- **Demo of Integration Testing**: Testing of the **Orpat digital Alarm Clock** using computer vision and the Robot Framework.
- **Input Automation**: Automated the input buttons (hour, minute, set, power off) of the clock using relay control connected via the serial port.
- **Capturing LCD Output**: Used a Document Camera to capture the LCD output, which was processed using **ffmpeg** and passed to the **SSOCR library** for reading the clock display.
- **Robot Framework Test Suite**: A Robot-based test suite was built to automate test execution.
- **Live Hardware Demo**: A live demo showcased the full hardware integration and testing process, making the experience amazing.

## The mailing list

Our mailing list, found [here
](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/chennaipy) is where all the 
communication related to Chennaipy happens. 

For those who are new to mailing lists, it is a common way for everyone in the
group to communicate. A mail that is sent to the mailing list is sent to everyone
who is subscribed to the list. 

The great part about this is the ability to reach a lot of people but also at the
same time one should remember that "With great power, comes great responsibility".

Mailing lists demand a certain degree of discipline so that the communication is
streamlined and consistent. The major reason for this is because mailing lists are
archived. Which means that years down the line, someone would probably be looking
at it. This demands that standards be followed when sending mails to the list.

In fact, they are a simple set of things to keep in mind. With a little bit of 
patience, mail chains can be very readable and a great source of information. 

[Shakthi Kannan](http://www.shakthimaan.com/) has a great presentation about 
mailing list etiquette. Here is the link: [Mailing list etiquette](http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/mailing-list-etiquette.pdf).

I would recommend everyone to go through that presentation before posting to the
mailing list. If you have any questions about it, please post it in the list
itself :) 

At Chennaipy, we are not very stringent on these practices but it is something
that is good to cultivate as we become better developers since almost all of the
major projects use them as their main line of communication.

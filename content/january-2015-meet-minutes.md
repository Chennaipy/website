Shrayas on Python. It gave a quick idea for people who are new to
Python.

The first lightning talk was on Image Processing by Akshaia Kumar. He

images. He also covered about filtering and thresholding.

The second topic was "How Python changed my view of programming" where
Rengaraj shared about how he came into the world of Programming and
Python's role in it. It was inspirational for many.

GitHub. His account is shrayasr in GitHub. He stressed on "scratch
your itch" for people to get involved.

The next session was "Exception handling in Python" by Amritanshu

talked about libcrypt, simulate projects.

Then came Shrikant Giridhar with the topic "Build your own CPU". He

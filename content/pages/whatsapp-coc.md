## Our Pledge

Welcome to the Chennaipy Community on WhatsApp\! Our goal is to create a vibrant, inclusive, and professional space for Python enthusiasts in Chennai to connect, learn, and collaborate. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or experience level.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all members within the entire WhatsApp community (all groups included)

Please be aware that joining our WhatsApp groups will make your phone number visible to all other members. We encourage you to be mindful of the personal information you share. For your safety, we advise against sharing sensitive personal details in the main group chats.

## The Short Version (TLDR)

1. **Be Respectful and Welcoming:** Treat all members with respect. There will be no tolerance for harassment of any kind.  
2. **Keep it Technical and On-Topic:** Discussion must be primarily about Python, software development, or local tech. Respectful humor is welcome.  
3. **Share and Collaborate:** Sharing personal, non-commercial, or open-source projects is highly encouraged. Job postings and political/religious discussions are not permitted.  
4. **Commercial Content Requires Approval:** Promotional content (paid products, services, ticketed events) must be approved by a moderator *before* posting.  
5. **Enforcement:** Moderators will handle violations with discretion, which may result in a reminder, a private warning, or an immediate and permanent ban.

## Our Standards: Fostering a Positive Community

We encourage all members to contribute to a positive environment. We invite you to:

* **Be Welcoming and Respectful:** Treat all members with respect. Appreciate that people have different backgrounds and levels of experience.  
* **Share and Collaborate:**  
  * Share interesting open-source or personal Python projects.  
  * Post relevant and interesting blog posts or articles.  
  * Ask for technical help and be willing to offer it to others.  
* **Stay On-Topic:** Keep conversations relevant to Python, software development, and our local tech community. On-topic and respectful humor, like memes related to programming, is welcome.  
* **Be Considerate:** Think before you speak. This is a professional networking space.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

* **Harassment:** Offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. This includes sexual imagery in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and unwelcome sexual attention.  
* **Promotional Content:**  
  * Promoting paid products, commercial services, or ticketed events must be approved by moderators first. However, sharing and collaborating on personal, non-commercial, and open-source projects is highly encouraged and does not require approval.  
  * To keep our main channels focused on technical discussion and collaboration, we do not permit job postings *at this time*. We may launch a dedicated channel for career opportunities in the future if there is sufficient community interest.  
* **Off-Topic and Inappropriate Discussions:**  
  * No political or religious discussions. These can be divisive and detract from the community's purpose.  
  * Avoid spamming the group with irrelevant content.  
* **Disrespectful Conduct:** Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

## Reporting Violations

If you witness or are the subject of unacceptable behavior, please report it immediately.

* **How to Report:** Contact any of the community moderators directly via a private message. The moderators will be clearly identified in the group description.  
* **Anonymity:** Your identity as a reporter will be kept completely anonymous. All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

## Enforcement

Our moderators will handle violations with discretion, always aiming to assume good faith and educate our members. Actions taken will correspond to the nature of the violation and may range from a gentle public reminder for a minor slip-up, to a private warning, or even an immediate and permanent ban for severe infractions like harassment.

For non-minor slip-ups, the following will be the process of enforcement:

* **First Instance:** A member engaging in unacceptable behavior will receive one official warning from a moderator.
* **Second Instance:** A second violation after a warning will result in a permanent ban from the WhatsApp community and all associated groups.

Moderators reserve the right to remove any content or member that they deem to be in violation of this Code of Conduct.

We value your participation in making this a thriving and respectful community for all Pythonistas in Chennai.

This Code of Conduct may be updated periodically by the moderators to reflect the evolving needs and values of our community.

The December meetup had kept me ([Vijay
Kumar](http://www.meetup.com/Chennaipy/members/147018982/)) excited
for various reasons. We were trying out a new / better meetup format -
lightning talks with discussions. We had about 9 lightning talks
scheduled for the event, from various domains including mathematics,
embedded systems, natural language processing and web
development. Also we had arranged for a 200 seater auditorium at IMSc
anticipating a large turn-out.

On the day of the event, the RSVPs on Meetup touched the 90 mark. And
based on previous experiences, we were expecting about 70, people
turning up for the event.

## The Venue

I finally arrived at the venue of the event, it was the first time I
was at the auditorium, and it was stunning. The auditorium was
equipped with best in class audio visual system. All seats, had a
foldable writing pad, very convenient for tech. events, like ours. In
short, the best venue we ever had for our meetups.

## Lightning Talks - I

By 3:15 PM we had a good number people already gathered, so we decided
to start. Two speakers had backed off so we did the following talks,
in the first session.

After the talks, we broke out for discussions and tea. Myself and
Shrayas volunteered to answer questions from newbies. It was good to
see people forming groups and discussing various topics.

## Lightning Talks - II

After the networking tea break, we had a second round of lightning
talks.

## Credits and Announcements

Before breaking out for discussions again, I made a few
announcements. One was about the Python Project effort that is
underway. This was to help newbies to go beyond just learning the
language. I then thanked all the people behind the meetup.

  * Venue: Prof. Amritanshu Prasad and IMSc
  * Networking over Tea, Sponsor: [Kagrana Software](http://kagrana.com/)
  * All the good hearted people on the mailing list, who helped spread
    the word.
  * The speakers, for coming forward to give a talk.
  * And everyone who turned up for the meetup, making it a grand
    success.

While reading out the credits, the crowd spontaneously started
clapping, for the venue. Looks like, everybody felt the same about the
venue.

We did a show of hands to find out, the format to go with for the next
meetup. Almost everybody liked the lightning talks format, and almost
everybody did not want large 40 minutes talk. Though people agreed
that a mix of the two, would also be good.

Shrayas, then requested the people present to come forward to
contribute. He also pointed out, how we are *all* equally responsible
in running the group. Hope we will be seeing more volunteers actively
contributing to the group.

## Discussions

<a

alt="Group Discussions" style="float: right"/></a>

We then broke out for discussions again. We were allowed to use the
Auditorium for 15 to 20 mins. And again people were forming groups,
discussing various topics, like how to promote the meetups, running
Python on embedded systems, how to learn Python, why people say Python
is easy, while it has complex things like decorators and metaclasses,
etc. The groups slowly dispersed and we finally left the venue biding
goodbye.

Though the turn out was low, with about 45 people participating, it
was the second largest meetup, we ever had. The exams and holidays at
various institutions must have contributed to the low turnout. That
aside, the December meetup was one of the best. I personally felt
that, we have reached a sweet spot, in terms of the venue and the
meetup format. And with the support from the community, we will
definitely be able to repeat this every month.

## Talks

### Introduction to GeoJson and GeoDjango

Speaker: Shrinidhi Kulkarni

I'll cover how to tag a place and store the co-ordinates in your
database and render back them on map. I would also like to give an
introduction on how to build custom maps using a tool called TileMill.

### Paho Python client for MQTT

Speaker: Shakthi Kannan

The Paho Python client [1] provides functions for communicating with
MQTT [2] brokers. This talk will be a quick start guide, and demo on
using the same.

 * [Paho Python](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/python/)
 * [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/)

### Introduction to Google App Engine

Speaker: Krithika Vembu

This talk will be an overview of how Google App Engine works.

### Towards probabilistic programming in Python

Speaker: Ronojoy Adhikari

Uncertainty is an integral part of the way we perceive the world. It
has been known since more than a century that probability theory is
the tool for reasoning about uncertainty. In the last two decades,
there has been explosion of the use of probabilistic methods in all
areas of science, engineering, medicine, and most recently, the
analysis of data, "big" or small. In implementing such methods using
generic computer languages, the main obstacle has been that computer
programs have no semantics of dealing with random variables. This
shortcoming leads to unnecessarily tedious code and a large gap
between theory and application. The idea of probabilistic programming
seeks to remedy this situation by creating programming languages in
which random variables are first class citizens. I will describe three
python packages that take the first steps in implementing
probabilistic programming paradigms and conclude with a survey of the
DARPA initiative of probabilistic programming.

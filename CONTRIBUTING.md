## Contributing Minutes of Meeting (MoM)

Meeting minutes live under `content/meeting_minutes/` organized by year.

- Location: `content/meeting_minutes/<year>/`
- File name: `YYYY-MM-mom.md`

### Front matter (required)

Use Hugo front matter at the top of the file (YAML format):

```yaml
---
title: "April 2015 Meetup Minutes"
date: 2015-04-26T19:00:00+05:30
tags: ["Meeting Minutes"]
summary: "Brief summary of the meetup (1–2 sentences)."
---
```

- title: Clear and descriptive
- date: Date/time of the meetup (with timezone preferred)
- tags: Always include `Meeting Minutes` (you may add more if relevant)
- summary: A one- or two-sentence overview (shown in lists/search)

## Add Upcoming Event

The homepage shows an upcoming event using data from `data/upcoming_event.yaml`

- Data file: `data/upcoming_event.yaml`


### Fields

- `title` (required): A short call-to-action followed by a hyphen and human-readable date/time. The text after ` - ` is displayed under the button.
  - Example: `"Join our upcoming October meetup - Saturday, October 26, 2025 at 3:00 PM (IST)"`
- `date` (required): Event date in `DD-MM-YYYY` format (zero‑padded day and month). Used to automatically hide the button on/after the event date.
  - Example: `"26-10-2025"`
- `venue` (optional): Venue name.
- `venue_link` (optional): A Google Maps URL or venue page.
- `link` (required): The full URL to the Meetup event.

> Ensure `date` uses leading zeros (e.g., `05-09-2025`, not `5-9-2025`).

### Example

```yaml
upcoming:
  title: "Join our upcoming October meetup - Saturday, October 26, 2025 at 3:00 PM (IST)"
  date: "26-10-2025"
  venue: "The Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc), Chennai"
  venue_link: "https://maps.app.goo.gl/koek7CfmSa95Adbm8"
  link: "https://www.meetup.com/chennaipy/events/311517051/"
```

### Behavior

- Before the event date: shows a button linking to the Meetup event, plus the formatted date/time and venue.
- After the event date: the upcoming-event button is hidden and a general "Join Our Meetup" link is shown instead.

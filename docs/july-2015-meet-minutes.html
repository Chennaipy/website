    <p>Yet another Chennaipy meetup with huge audience from different
background.  This time RSVP hit was 128. Good too see lot of people
came.  Vijay started with an introduction about the meetup. Vijay this
time used slides for meetup agenda.  Vijay explained clearly that
meetup won't teach Python but it gives pointers to various topics in
Python and how they are used.  So he insisted everyone to note down
what they don't understand in a talk and Google it to learn that.</p>
<h2>Automating testing using selenium</h2>

<p>As usual Vengat's favorite topic automation software using Python.  He
gave a talk on how they used selenium to upload Interview test
exercise to Cloud Coder.  He faced a problem that Cloud Coder has no
element ID to locate elements. He solved it using XPath.</p>
<h2>Data Science 101</h2>

<p>Gaurav gave a talk on how Pandas Numpy and Scikit Learn is used in
data science. He analyzed various data based on Titanic disaster data.
If I am right he uploaded the code to <a href="http://www.kaggle.com">kaggle</a>
to know how much accurate his prediction.</p>
<h2>Building Git From Scratch</h2>

<p>Vijay Kumar built a tiny Git and showed us how Git works.  In fact the
talk gave a broad view of how version control system works.  He
incrementally explained the implementation of tiny git. He changed the
actual git command to tig (the reverse of it :-)) He stopped the talk
at version 2 of tiny-git and left it to audience to read themselves.

<p>Shrayas and Karthick gave a combined presentation on PostgresSQL.</p>
<p>First Karthick gave his presentation on how rows are inserted in to
PostgresSQL DB. He explained Python code snippets for PostgresSQL
queries.</p>
<p>Next Shrayas explained why we should use PostgreSQL.  The interesting
thing is how he is developing such a wonderful presentation. I was
amazed to see the templates he used for his presentation.  He
explained the simplicity and speed of PostgreSQL DB.  He compared it
with traditional database like MySQL.</p>
<h2>Lightning Talk</h2>

<p>Yogeswaran shared his experience about Python podcast called <a href="http://talkpython.fm/">Talk

<p>Rajkumar shared his journey to develop a software for Automobile
industry from a non IT background. He quit TataMotors and started
learning lot of languages to choose a language for his product. He
researched almost 18 languages. He found that he is getting stuck at
some point on all those 18 languages. He met once Kenneth Gonsalves
and told about his problem.  He suggested to use Python. After that he
never stuck in his product development using Python.  The beauty of
this talk is the way he narrated the entire story five minutes with
lot of enthusiasm.</p>

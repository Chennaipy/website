<p>The meetup started about half hour late as there was another meeting
of #ValueFromData which ran late. After a small delay to check the
audio recording system, the session started with 3 lightning talks</p>
<h3>Talk 1: Leveraging Python Development with Virtual Environment</h3>
<p>Speaker Gaurav Sherawat started the talk briskly but ran into
technical problems, so talk was deferred.</p>
<h3>Talk 2: Building commandline interfaces with ArgParse</h3>
<p>Speaker Shanmuga presented the standard library module argparse and
how it can used to help process command line arguments including
features such as automatic type conversion, handling repeated
arguments and help screen generation.  Argparse improves on optparse
(which obsoleted getopt). Two similar package called docopts and click
were suggested by Shrayas uses for the same purpose.</p>
<h3>Talk 1: Continued</h3>
<p>The problem was a badly named python script called virtualenv.py in
the current directory.  Both virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper were
nicely explained and how they help manage python
installations. Someone from the audience(sorry I did not get the name)
cited occasions where virtualenv was not appropriate. This is when you
need to manually build C extensions and integrate with packages such
as numpy, scipy etc.</p>
<h3>Talk 3: Python, Gmail &amp; the IMAP protocol</h3>
<p>Speaker Shrayas focused on IMAP, the imaplib in the python stdlib and
specific Google extensions that make gmail accessible using the
imaplib api. These extensions allow for searching using imaplib in a
way similar to the search using gmail and using gmail labels using the
IMAP protocol.</p>
<p>After a brief networking tea break the next 3 lightning talks.</p>

<h3>Talk 4: for i in "Iterable"</h3>
<p>Speaker: Shrikant Giridhar's talk was based on a previous Ned
Batchelder's talk called Loop like a native. Shrikant brought out the
distinction between an iterable and an iterator which are often not
obvious in code since the same object can do both. This was a core
python talk and was received very well by the audience.</p>
<h3>Talk 5: Building a development environment using Vagrant</h3>
<p>Speaker: Vengatesh introduced Vagrant, a tool for creating and
managing a development environment which can run on local virtualized
platforms such as VirtualBox or VMware,</p>
<h3>Talk 6: Managing Desktops with Ansible</h3>
<p>Speaker Vijay Kumar's talk was an introduction to Ansible playbooks
which are recipes to deploy software on servers using the ssh
protocol. Both pull and pull form of deployment is possible.</p>

<p>After the talks there was a discussion of a possible extended talks in
future meetups.  20 minute talks could be considered for a more
elaborate presentation with a demo when required. There was a
subsequent talk on Net Neutrality which devolved into a full scale
free for all discussion.</p>
<p>A good time was had by all! Thank you to all the organizers.</p>

<h2>Talk Details</h2>
<h3>Image Processing with Python</h3>
<p>Speaker: Akshaia Kumar</p>
<p>This talk will be brief description of software available for image processing,<br>
various features, various outcomes that can be obtained, etc. Python will be 
used as the programming language. The talk will also cover various effects which 
are possible with the images along with how to code them.</p>
<h3>How Python Changed My View of Programming</h3>
<p>Speaker: Rengaraj</p>
<p>My journey into programming started with Python. The talk is about how Python 
made me to dive into programing which I never liked at college. Example programs 
which I have backup of, and my first Python project.</p>
<h3>My journey with the world of Open Source</h3>
<p>Speaker: <a href="http://www.shrayas.com">Shrayas Rajagopal</a></p>
<p>This talk is about how I got into the world of Open Source and what it has done 
to me, both as a programmer and as a person. We'll explore some of my earliest 
commits and Pull Requests as we go on a journey from then, till now.</p>
<h3>Exception Handling in Python</h3>
<p>Speaker: <a href="http://www.imsc.res.in/~amri/">Amritanshu Prasad</a></p>
<p>I will discuss the try-except protocol for exception-handling in python, explain 
the exception heirarchy and how to create new exception classes.</p>
<h3>PyStokes: A case study of accelerating Python using Cython</h3>
<p>Speaker: <a href="http://rajeshrinet.github.io/">Rajesh Singh</a></p>
<p>PyStokes is a Cython library for computing Stokes flows produced by spheres. The 
core of the library is written in Cython which can be called from pure python, 
so that the user can choose to work in pure python and still use the library. 
Read more on GitHub. I will also explain some basic usage of the Cython and how 
we have used it to accelerate our computations.</p>
<h3>Lessons from the Python Project: Hangman</h3>
<p>Speaker: <a href="http://bravegnu.org/">Vijay Kumar</a></p>
<p>As part of Chennaipy activities, we did a Hangman project.  Some cool things we 
did as part of the project - unit testing, supporting Python 2 and 3, code 
coverage analysis, packaging and distribution. This talk will give an overview 
of the lessons from the Python Project. </p>
<h3>Build your own CPU: An introduction to HDLs and FPGA development using Python</h3>
<p>Speaker: Shrikant Giridhar</p>
<p>The advent of affordable FPGAs with a decent number of gates has made hardware
design accessible for anyone interested. But describing hardware accurately in
software can be tricky. This is where HDLs come into the picture. And as with
everything else, there is a Python library for easing into writing pure HDL
code. This talk introduces development with MyHDL, a Python library to generate
descriptions of digital hardware. </p>

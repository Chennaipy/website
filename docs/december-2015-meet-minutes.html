            <p>The meetup started at 3:20 with the context setting done by Vijay. He
articulated the fact that the purpose of such meetups is to meet
people and exchange ideas and not to view this as a training or
workshop.</p>
<h2>Developing Odoo Modules</h2>
<p><a

<p>Ramadass Mahalingam gave the first talk on ODOO, an open source
equivalent of SAP. He spoke about the dependent packages, installation
requirements, the data types in Python. He followed it up by creating
a Chennaipy database and showing us how to modify the code for adding
a new field (PAN), a parameter needed in the database considering the
Indian context. He used ODOO version 9 for this.</p>
<h2>Python Byte Code Hacking</h2>
<p>The second talk was by Vijay, on Python Code byte hacking. This talk
was meant for educational purposes and to understand how Python works
internally.</p>
<p>He explained about bytecode, role of compilers, and the format of the
byte code given as input to the Python interpreter. It is to be noted
that the Python interpreter is modelled on a microprocessor and he
presented a few slides to motivate the same. He then spoke about stack
machines, dis-assembly and about hacking the constants in the Python
byte code.  He had written example codes for the same and ran it
during the talk.</p>
<p>Finally, the whole program was written completely in Python byte code
and there was no Python programming language statements at all.</p>
<h2>Python for Microcontrollers</h2>
<p><a

style="float:right; margin:0.5em"><img

<p>The third talk was given by Babu Subash Chander on MicroPython,i.e
using Python for microcontrollers.  He explained that MicroPython was
the work of Damien and spoke about the footprint size and the
associated details.  He then moved on to NuttX an RTOS and explained
the differences between 2 boards.</p>
<h2>Introduction to MIMO</h2>
<p>The final talk was on MIMO by Ashok Govindarajan. The talk was about
using multiple antennas for communication and how it results in
increased data rate for the user, resulting in faster downloads of
movies, etc in the users smart phone.</p>
<p>The 4G (LTE) architecture was taken for reference, and the User
equipment (Smart phone), base-station and the wireless channel between
the User equipment and the base station was explained. Post that an
analogy was given and the idea was extended to MIMO.</p>
<p><a

style="float:right; margin:0.5em"><img
src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/9/9/event_445444761.jpeg"></img></a></p>
<p>The core point of the talk was that data rate can be increased by 2 or
4 times by switching from SISO to MIMO using 2x2 or 4x4, with the same
amount of signal power as used in SISO.</p>
<p>The talk was concluded with references to massive MIMO and the state of
art as on Sep 2015. The role of machine algorithms was touched upon
and the libraries present in Python for the same were also explored.</p>
<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>
<p>We then moved on to the lightning talk where Mahesh from Duta systems
spoke about the work done in Duta.  They primarily provide content to
subscribers on WhatsApp. They are looking for Python experts and
interested people can write to jobs@duta.in</p>
<h2>Group Photo</h2>
<p>The session concluded with a group photo.</p>

    <p>After a long time we were back to IMSc Ramanujam auditorium.  The
meetup Intro was given by Abhishek.</p>
<p>We started with second talk since Shrayas was not available for this
meetup.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Celery</h2>
<p>The first talk was given by Shanmuga. He started explaining how and
why he started using Celery in his project. He continued with
requirement for setting up Celery like choosing a broker (RabbitMq or
Redis etc). He explained the advantages and disadvantages of those
brokers. Then he started explaining a prototype written by him.  I was
not available after some 4 slides since myself and Vengatesh left to
check the status of snacks and tea for the networking break.</p>
<h2>Short Introduction by every one.</h2>
<p>When I came back from canteen audience gave intro to themselves.
Mostly every one explained why they are coming for the meetup.
Since the tea is little bit late we continued with next session.</p>
<h2>Code Optimization in Python</h2>
<p>The second talk was given by Ashok on Code Optimization.  He started
the session by asking questions related to Optimization like Why
optimization is require ? Where we need to apply this concept ?  What
are all the things we need take care in Optimization ?  He explained
profiling in python and gave some reference.</p>
<h2>Networking Tea Break</h2>

<h2>Deep Learning with Tensor Flow</h2>

alt="Talk on Tensor Flow"/></a></p>
<p>The third talk was about Tensor Flow by Manish.  He explained how
Tensor Flow can use GPU to compute expressions in parallel.  If my
understanding is right, if there is an equation or problem which
relies input from other 10 equation in order to solve then the tensor
flow will evaluate each expression or problem in parallel and give 10
inputs to solve the final equation.  He actually porting
his hand written neural network application code to tensor flow.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Thanks to Vengatesh, Vinoth and Reegan for coordinating Networking
over tea.  Thanks Abhisek for hosting.</p>

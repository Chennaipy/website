            <p>The August edition of the ChennaiPy meetup had around 103 members RSVP for
participation in the Meetup page. Vijaykumar kickstarted the proceedings by
welcoming everyone and outlining the agenda for the evening.</p>
<h2>Introduction to GeoJson and GeoDjango</h2>
<p><a

<p>Shrinidhi Kulkarni started his talk by providing an outline of how maps are
organized and the three major components that make up any Geo application - a
Map provider, a JS library and a Geo-aware database. He went onto demonstrate
various features of the Leaflet JS library that includes initializing a map,
adding various shapes, tagging, filtering properties, etc. The server side was
written using GeoDjango and he managed to provide a quick walk through of some
key features such as the models. PointField and the ability to query geo
fields.  He closed the talk by listing some practical problems faced in
building his project and workarounds for the same. Though the talk ran over the
allotted time, it was well received by the audience judging by the follow-up
discussions during the break.</p>
<h2>Paho Python client for MQTT</h2>
<p><a

<p>The next talk was by Shakthi Kannan, a Free Software enthusiast and a
well-known face in the Chennai opensource space. Though the talk was originally
scheduled for the next edition of the meetup, a last minute reorg helped the
team to sneak in this talk in the current edition itself (to everyone's
delight, if I may add!). Even though Shakthi started with requesting everyone
to read the MQTT protocol docs for the details, he provided a good overview of
the protocol and its high-level architecture thus providing a good background
that made the rest of his talk easier to follow. He went onto explain the steps
involved in installing and testing an open-source MQTT broker - Mosquitto.
Finally the same tests were demonstrated using the Paho python client. He
closed his talk with lot of references for further reading.</p>

<p>The tea break, with refreshments sponsored by Zilogic Systems, was abuzz with
lot of small groups busy in spontaneous discussions.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Google App Engine</h2>
<p><a

<p>Krithika Vembu, inspired from the previous meetups, gave her first-ever talk in
the meetup. She gave an overview of Cloud-based architecture, its advantages
and the distinguishing aspects of a specific provider - the Google App Engine.
Though she was apologetic about not having live demos, her enthusiasm to
participate in the community and coming forward to speak in front of an
audience was applauded by everyone. Here is to more talks from her in the
future!</p>
<h2>Towards probabilistic programming in Python</h2>
<p><a
href="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/d/c/1/highres_441251713.jpeg">

alt="Prof. Ronojoy Adhikari" /> </a></p>
<p>This talk by Prof. Ronojoy Adhikari introduced everyone to a new way of dealing
with the complexity of implementing large scale inference engines by making use
of first-class abstractions about the randomness. There was a live demo of Lea,
a blackbox inference engine, showcasing ways in which the randomness was
modeled in popular problems such as throwing a dice, flipping a coin, etc. (The
program could have done a better job of predicting rains in Chennai though, as
it was raining on the morning of the meetup! :) ) One came away with lot of
motivation to explore the area further.</p>
<hr>
<p>Vijaykumar concluded the meeting with announcements on the preparations for the
PyCon Chennai conference and by thanking the participants, speakers,
volunteers, IMSc and the sponsors. Overall an evening well spent!</p>

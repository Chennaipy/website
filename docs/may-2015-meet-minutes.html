<p>Nikil took everyone into how we can build predictive models using
Dumbo. He highlighted how the legacy predictive model which uses
Python for modeling and use of java based system for production
environment. Finally, he clearly demonstrates how the DUMBO frameworks
helps data scientist to save enormous amount of time by building
predictive models and production environment with simple examples.</p>
<h2>3.42 PM - 4.20 PM: Memory Management in Python, Vijay kumar</h2>

<p>We had a classical talk once again from Vijay kumar, which helps
everyone to visualize how the memory is allocated to an variable in

an object in Python as well as how reference cycles occur and how the
cycle detection is implemented.</p>
<h2>4.20 PM - 4.51 PM: Break Time</h2>
<h2>4.52 PM - 5.13 PM: Face detection using opencv RaspberryPi, Gaurav</h2>

<p>Gourav demonstrated the face detection algorithm, which he developed
using OpenCV. He showed line by line the code for using OpenCV and for
capturing images using RaspberryPi camera module. Finally he shared
some of his hackathon experience to everyone.</p>
<h2>5.13 PM - 5.48 PM: All things <em>py</em>, Krishna</h2>
